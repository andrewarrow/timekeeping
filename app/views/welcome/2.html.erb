    <h2>Jail</h2>
     <p>
       Jail isn't the best.  And 5D8AA8 is no picnic.  Lots of creature gangs and corrupt guards.
       It's different at different facilities but at 5D8AA8 the guards are all large hippopotamus type
       creatures that walk upright on two legs.

       That's not the best situation for me.  I'm not a small creature but these guards have a good hundred units
       of weight on me. Not to mention the other creature gangs who will not like me.

     My infraction was chemicals.  I was caught with fourteen FFBF00 capsules.  But only twelve made it to my trial.
     I think the hippopotamus type creatures like FFBF00 too.

     <p>
     There was no running. Without a deal from the government I had no options. My lawyer and I walked to processing and parted
     company.
